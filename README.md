# CAN-restbus
application to send CAN signals from the CAN interface on a embedded board with CAN driver and CAN interface
Can be an alternative to CANOE restbus and avoid costs just for a simple restbu. Currently using custom messages hardcoded with intervals and signals.
Can be adapted to any restbus requiremnts based on the DBC.
